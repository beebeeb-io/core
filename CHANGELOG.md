## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Chunk format v2 (task 1908): file-content frames authenticate their position as AES-GCM
  associated data — `"beebeeb/chunk/v2" || len(file_id) || file_id || version_id(12) ||
  chunk_index || is_last` (STREAM construction) — and are sealed under a dedicated chunk subkey
  `HKDF-SHA256(file_key, "beebeeb/chunk/v2/key")` that no other blob type uses. `version_id` is
  the random nonce of the upload's frame 0, so frames of two uploads (versions) of one file id
  cannot be mixed. Previously (v1) frames carried no associated data, so a malicious server could
  reorder, duplicate, drop, truncate or splice chunks undetected. Same frame layout and sizes;
  the server is unaffected.
- Every file-content reader now REQUIRES an `ExpectedChunkFormat` taken from the file's
  encrypted metadata (`encrypt::decrypt_name_metadata[_with_key]`): `V2` accepts only v2 frames,
  so a server can no longer pass a same-key no-AAD blob (encrypted name, thumbnail) off as a
  one-frame v1 file; `Unrecorded` (metadata without a format: files from before the switch) lets
  frame 0 decide. Readers reject out-of-order frames, frames from another upload, frames after
  the last chunk, and fail at `finish()`/EOF when a v2 file ended early. A zero-frame body is now
  an error (it used to decrypt to an empty file). Uploads record the format with
  `encrypt::encrypt_name_with_chunk_format` (`"chunk_format": 2`); `encrypt_name` output is
  unchanged.
- Read-only rollout phase: `chunk_stream::WRITE_FORMAT` stays `V1Legacy`. Clients on this core
  read v2 but keep writing v1 until every client's read path is on this core; flipping it is a
  separate, gated release (task 1908).
- Breaking: `ChunkDecryptor::{from_reader, for_push, for_push_with_file_key}`,
  `encrypt::decrypt_chunks_to_file`, `encrypt::decrypt_contiguous_to_file`,
  `file_encrypt::decrypt_chunks_to_file`, `zip::ZipEntry` (new `chunk_format` field),
  `beebeeb_upload::{decrypt_downloaded_bytes, download_and_decrypt_file,
  DownloadClient::download_and_decrypt}` take the file id and/or the expected format;
  `chunk_stream::open_chunk` takes the version id. UniFFI: `decrypt_chunks_to_file`,
  `decrypt_contiguous_to_file`, `download_and_decrypt_file`, `MasterKeyHandle.decrypt_file`,
  `ChunkDecryptorHandle.{from_file, for_push, for_push_with_file_key}` take
  `expected_chunk_format` (0 = unrecorded, 2 = v2); `FileKeyHandle.decrypt_chunk_frame` takes
  `version_id`. WASM: `WasmChunkDecryptor` constructors take `expectedChunkFormat`;
  `decrypt_chunk_frame` takes `version_id`. New: `ExpectedChunkFormat`,
  `ChunkDecryptor::{version_id, format, chunks_decrypted, finish}`, `encrypt::{NameMetadata,
  decrypt_name_metadata, decrypt_name_metadata_with_key, encrypt_name_with_chunk_format}`,
  UniFFI `ChunkDecryptorHandle.{for_push_with_file_key_handle, version_id, chunk_format,
  finish}`, `MasterKeyHandle.{encrypt_name_with_chunk_format, decrypt_name_metadata}`,
  `FileKeyHandle.decrypt_name_metadata`, WASM `encrypt_name_with_chunk_format`,
  `decrypt_name_metadata[_with_key]`, `WasmChunkDecryptor.versionId`. Feature `test-support`
  (dev-dependencies only) exposes `ChunkEncryptor::with_format` to tests.
- Metadata domain separation (task 1908 review round 3): name/MIME envelopes and thumbnails can
  now be sealed under their own subkeys, `HKDF-SHA256(file_key, "beebeeb/name/v1")` and
  `HKDF-SHA256(file_key, "beebeeb/thumb/v1")`, so neither can ever open as file content (v1 or
  v2) or as each other. Every name reader (`decrypt_name*`, `decrypt_names`,
  `decrypt_*_metadata*`) and the new `encrypt::decrypt_thumbnail` try the subkey first, then the
  legacy raw file key, so every stored blob keeps opening. Writing: a name that records
  `chunk_format: 2` is always subkey-sealed; everything else follows
  `encrypt::METADATA_SEAL_WRITE`, which is tied to `WRITE_FORMAT` and stays `Legacy` during the
  read-only phase (clients not yet on this core must keep reading the names this core writes).
- `encrypt::decrypt_file_metadata[_with_key]` (task 1908 review round 3): the metadata reader for
  FILES. Same as `decrypt_name_metadata`, but a plaintext (non-JSON) `name_encrypted` is refused:
  a plaintext name carries no chunk-format pin, so a server could otherwise swap a v2 file's
  metadata for a plaintext name and re-enable frame-0 detection. Folders keep using
  `decrypt_name_metadata`.
- Resumed uploads (task 1908 review round 3): `chunk_stream::{SessionResume, resume_policy}` and
  `ChunkEncryptor::resume_policy`. A v2 upload's frames all bind one version id (frame 0's
  nonce), and a resumed upload builds a new encryptor with a new one, so continuing the old
  server session would store an unreadable mix. Only a v1 session resumed by a v1 encryptor may
  continue; anything else, including a resume record that does not say which format it holds,
  must restart from chunk 0 in a fresh session. Clients persist `ChunkEncryptor::format` next to
  the session id.
- New bindings: UniFFI `MasterKeyHandle.decrypt_file_metadata`,
  `FileKeyHandle.{decrypt_file_metadata, encrypt_thumbnail, decrypt_thumbnail}`,
  `ChunkEncryptorHandle.resume_policy` + enum `SessionResumeAction`; WASM
  `decrypt_file_metadata[_with_key]`, `encrypt_thumbnail`, `decrypt_thumbnail`,
  `WasmChunkEncryptor.resumePolicy`. `kdf::derive_file_subkey` is public.
- Replace / new version honours the file's recorded pin (task 1908 review round 4, I-1):
  `ChunkEncryptor::with_recorded_pin(pin)` writes v2 frames for a file whose encrypted metadata
  records v2, even while `WRITE_FORMAT` is still v1 (the server keeps a file's metadata on
  replace, so a v1 new version of a v2-pinned file would never open); `Unrecorded` keeps
  `WRITE_FORMAT`. One rule for content, names and thumbnails: `chunk_stream::chunk_format_for_pin`
  + `encrypt::metadata_seal_for` (`METADATA_SEAL_WRITE = metadata_seal_for(WRITE_FORMAT)`).
  New `encrypt::encrypt_thumbnail_for(file_key, plaintext, pin)` (a v2 pin is always
  subkey-sealed). Bindings: UniFFI `ChunkEncryptorHandle.apply_recorded_pin`,
  `FileKeyHandle.encrypt_thumbnail_for`; WASM `WasmChunkEncryptor.withRecordedPin`,
  `encrypt_thumbnail_for`. Restart path for resumed v2 uploads documented (abandon or lease
  expiry before re-init; never the old session on a 409).
- File notes get their own subkey (task 1908 review round 5): web sealed `note_encrypted` with
  `encrypt_metadata` under the raw file key, in the same envelope shape as a legacy name, so a
  server could serve a note as a v2 file's `name_encrypted` (read as a name with no pin) and then
  as its only frame (a one-frame v1 file), undoing the v2 pin. New
  `encrypt::{NOTE_KEY_INFO, encrypt_note, encrypt_note_for, decrypt_note}`: notes are sealed under
  `HKDF-SHA256(file_key, "beebeeb/note/v1")` with the same rule as names and thumbnails (a v2 pin
  is always subkey-sealed; `Unrecorded` follows `METADATA_SEAL_WRITE`), returned as the canonical
  `EncryptedBlob` JSON; `decrypt_note` tries the note subkey, then the legacy raw key. Bindings:
  UniFFI `FileKeyHandle.{encrypt_note, encrypt_note_for, decrypt_note}`; WASM `encrypt_note`,
  `encrypt_note_for`, `decrypt_note`. Clients must write and read notes through these (web
  `file-details-panel.tsx` follow-up).
- `with_recorded_pin` / `apply_recorded_pin` / `withRecordedPin` docs: `V2` only with the pin
  read from an existing file's authenticated metadata; a new file uses `WRITE_FORMAT` (doctest).

### Added
- `onboarding` module (task 1744): password-policy evaluator driven by the server's numbers
  (floored at the shipped 12), k-anonymity breached-password helper (hashing and matching
  only; no I/O, no third-party endpoint, fail-open or fail-closed as the server declares), and
  the signup ceremony state machine over the existing recovery-phrase and OPAQUE primitives.
  Exposed through native Rust, WASM (`WasmBreachCheck`, `WasmSignupCeremony`,
  `evaluate_password`) and UniFFI (`BreachCheckHandle`, `SignupCeremonyHandle`,
  `evaluate_password`). New dependency: `sha1` (corpus addressing only). The ceremony takes a
  `BreachCheck` bound to the password (never a bare verdict), treats an empty or oversized
  breach-endpoint body as an outage, exposes `wipe()` (`abandon()` in the bindings) and
  `email_changed()`, and floors the password minimum at the shipped 12.
- `direct_transfer` module (task 2173): the client-side rules of the direct S3 transfer contract
  v1 as pure Rust (no I/O, no clock): wire types, the storage-link authority check
  (`check_storage_url`, `redact`, `scrub`), the API-answer classifier, the download window
  planner and the discovery cache. Exposed through native Rust, WASM (`WasmDownloadPlanner`,
  `WasmDirectDiscoveryCache`, `checkStorageUrl`, `classifyDirectAnswer`, `parseDirectDiscovery`,
  `redactUrl`, `scrubText`, `directTransferConstants`) and UniFFI (`DirectDownloadPlannerHandle`,
  `DirectDiscoveryCacheHandle`, `direct_check_storage_url`, `classify_direct_answer`,
  `parse_direct_discovery`, `direct_redact_url`, `direct_scrub_text`, `direct_transfer_constants`).
  Stable `code()`/`kind()` names on `Refusal`, `Call`, `Outcome`, `Violation`, `PlanError`,
  `Verdict`, `Poll`. `test-vectors/direct_transfer.json` is run by core, the WASM seams and the
  UniFFI exports through one interpreter (`direct_transfer::vectors`, `test-support`).
- CI `Claims guard` job: runs the shared claims-guard engine plus
  `scripts/claims-guard/canon-sweep.sh`, the canon CLAIM_SWEEP over the whole tree
  (including any `design/` folder), so a false audit or compliance claim fails the build.

### Changed

### Fixed
- Nothing yet.

### Removed
- `design/hifi/`: a stale snapshot of UI mockups committed with the initial import. Its mockup
  copy claimed that this code had been externally audited (naming a security firm and a date)
  and named the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act as a fit. Neither was ever true: `core`
  has **not** had an external audit (see "Audit status" in the README). The mockups live in
  the private design workspace; this repo is the crypto core.
